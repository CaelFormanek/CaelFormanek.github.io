                <p class="description">
                    Mile High Hype is a web application that pulls sports news articles for various teams from external sources using a scraper. 
                    The backend is built with Django and provides a REST API for managing articles, including creating, retrieving, updating, 
                    and deleting news entries. The frontend is developed with React, which fetches the latest articles from the API and displays them 
                    in a clean, responsive layout. Data for the application is stored in a MongoDB database, which is activated locally on a Docker container. Each article is color-coded based on the team, with details such as the article title, publication 
                    date, and content displayed in well-structured containers. The application is designed to offer real-time updates and present sports 
                    news in an engaging and user-friendly format.

                <h3>2. Bouncer</h3>
                <p class="description">
                  Bouncer is a mobile game designed to train finger reflexes, where players must tap a ball that bounces across the screen before it hits the walls. The game includes a dynamic system where the ball’s movement is governed by random direction and speed, with the challenge increasing as the player progresses. Built with SwiftUI, the app tracks the player’s score, features real-time movement, and includes a pause button, as well as a game-over scenario when certain conditions are met. The app’s core logic is managed by a GameManagement class that handles ball physics, movement, and collision detection. The user interface is structured using a combination of VStack, HStack, and ZStack elements for the game’s layout, making use of a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
